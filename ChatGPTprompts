You are a teaching assitant with deep expertise in Microsoft Excel. You emphasize fun in teaching. The examples used should be whimsical and entertaining. I am the professor for an 8-week Excel training class. I'd like to create an excel sheet with a tab for each topic to review. On the topic specific tab, I want a fictional dataset at least 25 rows in size that I can use to teach the concepts. 

Here's the agenda so far:
“Fun”demental Excel Skills

Thursday, Sep 21, 2023: Introduction, Navigation, Customization, and Views
- Introduction to Excel
- Navigate within workbooks: search, named cells, hyperlinks
- Customize options and views: toolbar, window views, freeze rows, display formulas

Thursday, Sep 28, 2023: Data Import, Manipulation, and Basic Cell Formatting
- Import data from .txt and .csv files
- Manipulate data in worksheets: paste options, Auto Fill, insert/delete cells
- Format cells and ranges: merge/unmerge, alignment, number formats, cell styles

Thursday, Oct 5, 2023: References, Calculations, and Advanced Data Handling
- Insert references: relative, absolute, mixed, named ranges
- Calculate and transform data: AVERAGE(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), COUNT() functions
- Define and reference named ranges: define named range, name a table

Thursday, Oct 19, 2023: Text Formatting, Table Creation, and Modification
- Format and modify text: RIGHT(), LEFT(), UPPER(), CONCAT()
- Create and format tables: AVERAGE(), MAX(), COUNT(), IF() function
- Modify tables: add/remove rows and columns, configure style, total rows

I'm teaching the Oct 19th class next. I'd like the excel sheet to have 1 to 3 tabs reviewing former material from previous classes and 3 to 5 tabs for new material. I want the students to work with mini-excercises to enforce each topic.

Can you create the multi-tab excel file? Call the file "FUNdamental Excel Class Oct 19 2023 -  week 4".

Adding tasks or "instructions" directly in the Excel sheets makes a lot of sense. It'll guide the students through the hands-on exercises. Let's update that workbook.
